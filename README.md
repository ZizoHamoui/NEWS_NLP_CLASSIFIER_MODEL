# NEWS_NLP_CLASSIFIER_MODEL
For our project, we have created a supervised text classification model that would help categorize news articles into six different categories depending on their topic; Business, Entertainment, Health, News, Politics, and Sports. The current issue we are trying to address is the way news platforms suggest generic content that is shown on their home page for all their users. Our project aims to use NLP model BERT to classify articles. News websites will be able to utilize this data and show the users what they are interested in. We believe that this is an important problem to address as it would benefit news website to retain traffic from users and to help them increase overall retention time on their platform. A reliable classifier like ours if successful enables news platforms to re-rank or filter articles in real time on personal computers like mobiles and laptops which helps users avoid irrelevant content.
